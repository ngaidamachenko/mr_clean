## Task
The task here was to scrape information from a Wikipedia article about 
the ozone layer and analyze the frequency or relevance of the terms making
up the article.

## Description
The problem was solved by using the requests package to extract information
from the Wikipedia API, followed by using built-in Python data structures 
to store frequency information about the terms used in the article, and 
finally by using the pandas and seaborn packages to plot the frequency of 
terms and bigrams in the article.

## Installation
In addition to a Jupyter and Python 3 installation, the following python 
packages are required:
requests, re, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and sklearn

## Usage
To complete the analysis, simply execute all the cells in the jupyter notebook.
